Interactive scatter plot of the United States Statistics utilizes the CDC and Census SAIPE database displaying recorded Obesity rate, Poverty rate, and Income of each state from years 2020-2023. Additionally, the dataset separates each state by their region (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West). Before graphing, each of values represented were averaged out among the years recorded by State. In the scatter plot, points were plotted on an average obesity rate vs average median income graph with the size of the points being the average poverty rate (%). Additionally, a radio button was implemented that allows the user to interact with the graph by isolating each region on the map (makes other plotted points grey). A tooltip interaction was also implemented that shows exact values for each plotted point. Conclusions can be drawn out with the south generally occupying the points towards the top left of the graph, or the high obesity and low income region. Additionally, the northeast region generally occupy the points towards the bottom right of the graph, or the low obesity and high income region. The other regions display mixed results. Overall, this graph can give you an idea of the correlation of obesity rate and income / poverty rate of the United States as well as where each region resides in on the graph.
The "SNAP Benefits Map (June 2025)" interactive choropleth map visualizes SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits across all 50 states using data sourced from USDA SNAP program records. The design choice of a choropleth map was intentional, as geographic encoding allows users to quickly identify regional patterns in food assistance distribution. Two toggle buttons were implemented below the map, enabling users to switch between "Average Benefits per Participating Household" and "Average Benefits per Participating Person"—two distinct metrics that tell different stories about food assistance. The color gradients (blue for household, green for person) use darker shades to represent higher benefit amounts, following intuitive "more = darker" visual conventions. A tooltip interaction reveals detailed statistics on hover, including total SNAP benefits, number of participating households and persons, and the calculated per-unit averages. Key insights from this visualization include the significantly higher benefits in Hawaii and Alaska, attributable to their elevated cost of living and food prices due to geographic isolation. This map serves as a foundation for understanding how food assistance varies geographically before correlating it with obesity rates.
The "SNAP Benefits per Participating Person by State" static horizontal bar chart complements the interactive map by providing a precise, sortable comparison across all states. The design choice of a horizontal bar chart was made for two reasons: first, horizontal orientation accommodates the 50 state labels without rotation or truncation, improving readability; second, sorting states from highest to lowest benefit amount enables immediate identification of outliers and distribution patterns. Each bar displays its exact dollar value at the end, eliminating the need for users to reference the axis for precise figures. The consistent green color ties this visualization to the "per person" view on the choropleth map, maintaining visual coherence across the project. This static format is ideal for reporting purposes and allows for direct comparison—revealing that Hawaii ($355.21) receives more than double Minnesota's benefits ($160.04), a 55% difference. The chart reinforces the theme that SNAP benefits are adjusted for regional cost of living rather than distributed uniformly, which has implications for analyzing the relationship between food assistance and obesity outcomes.
The "Health Expenditures by Country 1957 to x" interactive map gives a breakdown of what a given county spent its budget on in a given year. This map specifically looks at health expenditures which includes county level health programs like County Health Departments, Public Health Clinics and Community health outreach. The counties that failed to report for a given year are given a dashed border similar to a hatching pattern. The coloring gradient is relative to the all-time high/low of county level per capita health expenditures. This allows the user when sliding through the years to view the evolution of county level health expenditures from 1957 to 2006 for insights into local trends.
The goal with the "Obesity Rate & State Spending by Category (2021-2023)" visualization is to see if there is any relation between a states expenditures on Education, Public Welfare, and Health and that states Obesity rate. Both the top and bottom bar charts share the same X-axis. This x axis is the the states who reported obesity rates from 2021-2023 sorted by obesity rate. The top bar chart shows the actual obestiy rate of that state with its y axis. The color of that bar chart encodes the year. The bottom graph shows the total dollar spending on the three listed categories for each year (if reported). The colors show the percentage which was spent on each of the three categories. By showing multiple years my goal was to show if there was a consistency across the years for the revealed relationship between obesity rate and health expenditures.
