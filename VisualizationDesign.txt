1. Interactive scatter plot of the United States Statistics utilizes the CDC and Census SAIPE database displaying recorded Obesity rate, Poverty rate, and Income of each state from years 2020-2023. 
Additionally, the dataset separates each state by their region (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West). 
Before graphing, each of values represented were averaged out among the years recorded by State. 
In the scatter plot, points were plotted on an average obesity rate vs average median income graph with the size of the points being the average poverty rate (%). 
Additionally, a radio button was implemented that allows the user to interact with the graph by isolating each region on the map (makes other plotted points grey). 
A tooltip interaction was also implemented that shows exact values for each plotted point. 
Conclusions can be drawn out with the south generally occupying the points towards the top left of the graph, or the high obesity and low income region. 
Additionally, the northeast region generally occupy the points towards the bottom right of the graph, or the low obesity and high income region. 
The other regions display mixed results. 
Overall, this graph can give you an idea of the correlation of obesity rate and income / poverty rate of the United States as well as where each region resides in on the graph.


5. The "Health Expenditures by Country 1957 to x" interactive map gives a breakdown of what a given county spent its budget on in a given year. This map specifically looks at health expenditures which includes county level health programs like County Health Departments, Public Health Clinics and Community health outreach.
The counties that failed to report for a given year are given a dashed border similar to a hatching pattern. The coloring gradient is relative to the all-time high/low of county level per capita health expenditures.
This allows the user when sliding through the years to view the evolution of county level health expenditures from 1957 to 2006 for insights into local trends. 

6. The goal with the "Obesity Rate & State Spending by Category (2021-2023)" visualization is to see if there is any relation between a states expenditures 
on Education, Public Welfare, and Health and that states Obesity rate. Both the top and bottom bar charts share the same X-axis. This x axis 
is the the states who reported obesity rates from 2021-2023 sorted by obesity rate. The top bar chart shows the actual obestiy rate of that state 
with its y axis. The color of that bar chart encodes the year. 
The bottom graph shows the total dollar spending on the three listed categories for each year (if reported). The colors show the percentage which 
was spent on each of the three categories. 
By showing multiple years my goal was to show if there was a consistency across the years for the revealed relationship between obesity rate and
health expenditures.
