1. Interactive scatter plot of the United States Statistics utilizes the CDC and Census SAIPE database displaying recorded Obesity rate, Poverty rate, and Income of each state from years 2020-2023. Additionally, the dataset separates each state by their region (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West). Before graphing, each of values represented were averaged out among the years recorded by State. In the scatter plot, points were plotted on an average obesity rate vs average median income graph with the size of the points being the average poverty rate (%). Additionally, a radio button was implemented that allows the user to interact with the graph by isolating each region on the map (makes other plotted points grey). A tooltip interaction was also implemented that shows exact values for each plotted point. Conclusions can be drawn out with the south generally occupying the points towards the top left of the graph, or the high obesity and low income region. Additionally, the northeast region generally occupy the points towards the bottom right of the graph, or the low obesity and high income region. The other regions display mixed results. Overall, this graph can give you an idea of the correlation of obesity rate and income / poverty rate of the United States as well as where each region resides in on the graph.
