            <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Over the past several decades, obesity has existed as an overwhelming public health challenge in the United States, varying across states. 
                Simultaneously, economic disparities across these states have influenced citizens' access to healthy foods, diet, and overall quality of life. 
                Metrics such as GDP per capita and state food assistance programs (like SNAP) encapsulate these disparities and may coincide with variations in obesity rates. 
                This project investigates the possible connection between obesity rates, income, and food assistance across the U.S., with the goal of understanding why some states have higher obesity rates.

            <h2>United States Statistics (2020-2023)</h2>
            <p>
                The following visualizations show statistics of obesity rate, poverty rate, and income among all U.S. states from 2020–2023.
            </p>

            <h3>Tooltip Scatterplot of Yearly Statistics among States</h3>
            <p>
                This scatterplot shows obesity rate (%) vs average income ($) for each state. Hover over points to see detailed statistics. Points are colored by U.S. region.
            </p>

            <div class="responsive-iframe">
                <iframe src="static.html"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                Higher obesity rates generally correspond with lower average income across states.
            </p>

            <h3>Regional Scatterplot Visualization</h3>
            <p>
                Similar to the previous plot, this graph allows users to highlight U.S. regions. Colors and opacity differentiate regions for better understanding.
            </p>

            <div class="responsive-iframe">
                <iframe src="interactive.html"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The South tends to have high obesity and low income (top-left), while the Northeast tends to have low obesity and high income (bottom-right). Other regions show mixed results.

            <h2>SNAP Benefits Map (June 2025)</h2>
            <p>
                This interactive choropleth map visualizes SNAP benefits per household and per person in June 2025. Hovering over states shows detailed data. Blue = per household, green = per person.
            </p>

            <div class="responsive-iframe">
                <iframe src="snap_map.html"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                People in Hawaii and Alaska receive the most support, likely due to higher costs of living.
            </p>

            <h3>SNAP Benefits per Participating Person by State – June 2025</h3>
            <p>
                This horizontal bar chart shows SNAP benefits per person by state, from lowest to highest.
            </p>

            <img src="snap_per_person_horizontal_static.png" 
                 alt="SNAP per Participating Person by State" 
                 class="responsive-img">

            <p>
                Hawaii and Alaska are outliers, receiving nearly double the national average due to high food costs. New York also ranks high, while Midwest states receive lower benefits. West Virginia appears higher than expected, indicating cost-of-living adjustments.
