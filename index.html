    <h1 style="color: blue;">Mapping Obesity, Income, and Food Assistance in the U.S.</h1>

    <hr style="border: 2px solid #333; margin: 30px 0;">

    <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>

    <p id='main'>
       Over the past several decades, obesity has existed as an overwhelming public health challenge in the United States, varying across states. 
        Simultaneously, economic disparities across these states have influenced these citizens' access to healthy foods, diet, and overall quality of their lifestyle. 
        For instance, metrics such as GDP per capita and state food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),  
        across states encapsulate these existing disparities and could coincide with the variation in obesity rates across the country. 
        This project investigates the possible connection of obesity rates to income and food assistance across the United States. 
        We find this topic interesting as it could uncover the reason as to why some states have higher obesity rates compared to others. 
        Additionally, our results could suggest whether food assistance addresses nutrient deficits or inadvertently contributes to the obesity rate of that specific state.

    <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">United States Statistics (2020-2023)</h3>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">Data Explanation</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       This visualization uses state-level data on obesity rates, poverty rates, and median household income from 2020–2023, compiled by the CDC and Census SAIPE and obtained via Kaggle. The dataset includes all 50 U.S. states categorized by region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), allowing for regional comparison of health and economic indicators.
    </p>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">How to Use This Graph</h4>
    <p id='main'>
        This interactive scatterplot displays obesity rate on the y-axis and median household income on the x-axis. Each point represents a state-year observation. Use the buttons below the graph to highlight specific regions by color—this will make the selected region's points opaque while fading other regions. Hover over any point to see detailed information about that specific state and year, including its exact obesity rate, income, poverty rate, and regional classification.

        style="border:none;">
    </iframe>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">Interpretation</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       The visualization reveals clear regional patterns in the relationship between income and obesity. Southern states predominantly occupy the upper-left quadrant, indicating high obesity rates paired with lower median incomes. In contrast, Northeastern states cluster in the lower-right quadrant, showing lower obesity rates alongside higher incomes. This geographic divide suggests that economic factors play a significant role in obesity prevalence. The Midwest and West regions display more varied patterns, with states scattered across the graph, indicating that regional factors beyond simple income levels may influence obesity outcomes in these areas.

    <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">SNAP Benefits Map (June 2025)</h3>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">Data Explanation</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       This visualization uses June 2025 SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) data from the USDA, including total benefits distributed, number of participating households, and number of participating persons for each state (U.S. territories excluded). From this data, we calculated two metrics: average benefits per participating household and average benefits per participating person, which reveal how SNAP support varies geographically.
    </p>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">How to Use This Graph</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       This interactive choropleth map allows you to explore SNAP benefits across the United States using a color-coded system. Click the buttons below the map to toggle between two views: "Per Household" (shown in blue gradient) and "Per Person" (shown in green gradient). Darker colors indicate higher benefit amounts. Hover your cursor over any state to see a tooltip displaying that state's total SNAP benefits, number of participating households and persons, and the selected metric's value. The color scales are independent for each metric to highlight variation within that specific measure.

    </iframe>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">Interpretation</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       The map reveals substantial geographic variation in SNAP benefits, with Alaska and Hawaii receiving dramatically higher benefits per person and per household compared to other states. This pattern is primarily attributable to the significantly higher cost of living in these states—particularly food costs, which can be 50-90% higher than the continental U.S. due to shipping expenses and geographic isolation. States in the Midwest and South generally receive lower per-person benefits, reflecting their lower costs of living. This demonstrates that SNAP benefit calculations are adjusted for regional economic disparities, though questions remain about whether these adjustments adequately address nutritional needs in each location.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">SNAP Benefits per Participating Person by State – June 2025</h3>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">Data Explanation</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       This chart uses the same June 2025 USDA SNAP data as the map above but presents it in a different format to facilitate state-by-state comparison. The metric shown is SNAP benefits per participating person, calculated by dividing total state benefits by the number of participating persons in each state.
    </p>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">How to Use This Graph</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       This static horizontal bar chart displays all 50 states sorted from lowest to highest SNAP benefits per person. The length of each bar corresponds to the dollar amount of benefits per participating person. Simply scan from top to bottom to see which states provide the least and most SNAP support per individual. The sorted arrangement makes it easy to identify outliers and compare your state of interest to others.

         style="display:block; margin:auto; border:1px solid #ccc;">

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">Interpretation</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       The chart reveals dramatic variation in SNAP benefits across states. Hawaii and Alaska are clear outliers, receiving nearly double the national average—Hawaii's per-person benefits are approximately $195 higher (55% more) than Minnesota's, the lowest-receiving state. This disparity reflects differences in cost of living rather than poverty levels, as evidenced by West Virginia's placement despite its high poverty rate. New York's high ranking likely reflects elevated food costs in New York City and other urban areas. The lowest-receiving states are predominantly in the Midwest, where living costs, particularly for food, tend to be lower. This distribution suggests that SNAP calculations heavily weight geographic cost of living, appropriately adjusting benefits to maintain similar purchasing power across different economic contexts.

    <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">County Health Expenditures (1957-2006)</h3>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">Data Explanation</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       This visualization uses the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gov-finances/data/historical-data.html">Historical County Government Finance dataset</a> from the Census Bureau, spanning 1957 to 2006. The data includes county-level expenditures broken down by category, with this map specifically focusing on health expenditures. These health expenditures encompass county-funded programs such as county health departments, public health clinics, and community health outreach initiatives. The metric shown is per capita health spending, calculated by dividing total county health expenditures by county population.
    </p>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">How to Use This Graph</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       This animated choropleth map shows county health expenditures per capita across the United States from 1957 to 2006. The color scale is relative to the entire 50-year dataset, with darker colors indicating higher per capita spending. Use the play button or slider at the bottom to animate through the years and observe how health spending evolved over time. You can also hover over individual counties to see specific expenditure values. Note that blank areas indicate either missing data or counties that did not report health expenditures for that year.
    </p>

        width="1000" 
        height="600" 
        style="border:none;">
    </iframe>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">Interpretation</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       The animation reveals two significant trends over the 50-year period. First, per capita county health expenditures increased substantially across most of the United States, indicating growing investment in local public health infrastructure. Second, reporting of health expenditures became more comprehensive and widespread, as evidenced by fewer blank areas on the map in later years. While SNAP is a federally funded program, this visualization demonstrates that many health initiatives operate at the local level. The increasing investment in county health departments and community health programs suggests a growing recognition of the importance of localized public health interventions, which may complement federal programs like SNAP in addressing broader health outcomes including obesity.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">State Expenditures and Obesity Rates (2021-2023)</h3>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">Data Explanation</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       This visualization combines two data sources: obesity rates from the CDC (averaged across 2021-2023 for each state) and state government expenditure data from the Annual Survey of State Government Finances (ASFIN) for 2021-2023. The expenditure data focuses on three categories—Health, Public Welfare, and Education—and shows each state's spending in these categories as a percentage of the total across all three. This allows for comparison of spending priorities relative to health outcomes.
    </p>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">How to Use This Graph</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       This dual-chart visualization consists of two graphs sharing a common x-axis. The top chart displays the average obesity rate for each state across 2021-2023 as bars. The bottom chart shows stacked areas representing the proportion of each state's spending dedicated to Health (bottom layer), Public Welfare (middle layer), and Education (top layer). States are sorted along the x-axis from lowest to highest obesity rate, allowing you to visually track how spending patterns relate to obesity outcomes as you move from left to right.
    </p>

    <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
    <script src="obesity-poverty2.js"></script>

    <h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 15px;">Interpretation</h4>
    <p id='main'>
       The visualization suggests a relationship between state spending priorities and obesity outcomes, though the pattern is complex. States with lower obesity rates (on the left side of the chart) tend to show higher overall investment in the combined categories of Health, Public Welfare, and Education. However, no single spending category emerges as the clear driver of better outcomes. Some low-obesity states prioritize health spending, while others emphasize education or public welfare. This indicates that comprehensive investment across multiple sectors—rather than focusing on a single category—may be most effective in addressing obesity. The variation in spending patterns among states with similar obesity rates also suggests that factors beyond state expenditures, such as regional culture, food environment, and local policies, play important roles in determining obesity prevalence.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p id='main'>
        This project explored the relationships between obesity, income, and food assistance across the U.S. Key findings include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Regional Patterns:</strong> Southern states show high obesity and low income, while Northeastern states tend to have lower obesity and higher income, suggesting economic factors influence obesity, though inconsistently.</li>
        <li><strong>SNAP Benefits:</strong> Per-person SNAP benefits vary widely, with Hawaii and Alaska receiving nearly double the national average. Variations are driven more by cost of living than poverty rates, raising questions about their effectiveness in improving nutrition.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Health Spending:</strong> County and state-level health expenditures have increased over time, and higher investments in health, welfare, and education correlate with better obesity outcomes. No single spending category stands out, indicating comprehensive strategies may be most effective.</li>
    </ul>

    <p id='main'>
        Overall, obesity results from the interplay of economic conditions, regional characteristics, food assistance, and public health investments. While SNAP and similar programs help address food insecurity, high obesity rates in low-income areas suggest that access to food alone is insufficient. Effective interventions likely need to address food quality, nutrition education, healthcare access, and economic opportunities.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">Limitations</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Temporal Misalignment:</strong> Datasets span different periods, limiting causal conclusions.</li>
        <li><strong>Correlation vs. Causation:</strong> Observed associations (e.g., low income and high obesity in the South) do not imply causation.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregate Data:</strong> State- and county-level data hide individual variations; SNAP participation effects on obesity remain unclear.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing Variables:</strong> Factors like healthcare access, exercise opportunities, food deserts, cultural diets, and local policies were not included.</li>
        <li><strong>SNAP Interpretation:</strong> We do not assess how benefits translate into nutrition or health outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Scope:</strong> Analysis is U.S.-specific, preventing international comparison.</li>
        <li><strong>Directionality:</strong> Some relationships may be reversed or driven by unmeasured factors (e.g., obesity driving public spending).</li>
    </ul>

    <p id='main'>
        These limitations suggest caution in interpretation; more detailed, longitudinal, and individual-level research is needed for stronger causal insights.
