    <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>

    <p id='main'>
       Over the past several decades, obesity has existed as an overwhelming public health challenge in the United States, varying across states. 
        Simultaneously, economic disparities across these states have influenced these citizens' access to healthy foods, diet, and overall quality of their lifestyle. 
        For instance, metrics such as GDP per capita and state food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),  
        across states encapsulate these existing disparities and could coincide with the variation in obesity rates across the country. 
        This project investigates the possible connection of obesity rates to income and food assistance across the United States. 
        We find this topic interesting as it could uncover the reason as to why some states have higher obesity rates compared to others. 
        Additionally, our results could suggest whether food assistance addresses nutrient deficits or inadvertently contributes to the obesity rate of that specific state.

    <h1 font-size: 24px;">United States Statistics (2020-2023)</h1>

    <p id='main'>
       The following visualizations are about the statistics of obesity rate, poverty rate, and income among all states of America from the years 2020–2023.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Tootltip Scatterplot of Yearly Statistics among States</h2>
    
    <p id='main'>
       This plot displays yearly statistics for each state from years 2020-2023 on a Obesity Rate (%) vs Average Income ($) scatterplot.
        Here, you can hover your cursor above each plotted point and get a more in-depth analysis of each state and their corresponding statistics. 
        All points are also marked with colors for the US region they reside in.
    </p>

    <p id='main'>
       From this plot, we can see how generally, the higher the obesity rate of a state, the lower their average income is.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Regional Scatterplot Visualization</h2>

    <p id='main'>
       This plot is a similar graph to the Tooltip Scatterplot but has an additional interaction where the user can highlight each region of the United States.
        From here, we are able to differentiate each region on the map by color and opacity to help the user better understand the difference between the regions.

    <p id='main'>
       From this plot, we can see how the south generally occupy the points towards the top left of the graph, or the high obesity and low income region. 
        Additionally, the northeast region generally occupy the points towards the bottom right of the graph, or the low obesity and high income region.
        The other regions display mixed results.

    <h2>SNAP Benefits Map (June 2025)</h2>

<p id='main'>
   This map shows SNAP benefits per participating household and per participating person for each state in June 2025. 
   You can toggle between per household and per person using the buttons below the map.

<p>
   This uses <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gov-finances/data/historical-data.html">Historical County Government finance data set</a> for the Census Bureau.
   This gives a breakdown of what a given county spent its budget on in a given year. This map specifically looks at health expenditures which includes county level health programs like
   County Health Departments, Public Health Clinics and Community health outreach.
</p>
<p>
   SNAP is a federally funded program however there are many health initiatives to be started at a local level. This map shows the county health expenditures per capita in the USA from 1957 to 2006.
   The coloring is relative to the entire dataset. This map shows us that not only have expenditures at a county level increased greatly in the past 50 years but also 
   reporting of heath expenditures has increased.

<p>
This graph uses the ASFIN dataset from 2021-2023. 
The top graph uses the average obestiy rate at a state level from 2021 to 2023. 
The bottom graph overlays each states expenditures in Health, Public Welfare and Education as a percentage of the total of those three categories.
They share an x axis which is sorted by average obesity rate of the 3 years for that given state.
</p>

<p>
This graph reveals that overall investments in health intialtives and general public wellbeing improve obesity rates at a state level. However there is no clear category which is most effective 
from the data presented.
