       Over the past several decades, obesity has existed as an overwhelming public health challenge in the United States, varying across states. 
        Simultaneously, economic disparities across these states have influenced these citizens' access to healthy foods, diet, and overall quality of their lifestyle. 
        For instance, metrics such as GDP per capita and state food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),  
        across states encapsulate these existing disparities and could coincide with the variation in obesity rates across the country. 
        This project investigates the possible connection of obesity rates to income and food assistance across the United States. 
        We find this topic interesting as it could uncover the reason as to why some states have higher obesity rates compared to others. 
        Additionally, our results could suggest whether food assistance addresses nutrient deficits or inadvertently contributes to the obesity rate of that specific state.
