    <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>

    <p id='main'>
       Over the past several decades, obesity has existed as an overwhelming public health challenge in the United States, varying across states. 
        Simultaneously, economic disparities across these states have influenced these citizens' access to healthy foods, diet, and overall quality of their lifestyle. 
        For instance, metrics such as GDP per capita and state food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),  
        across states encapsulate these existing disparities and could coincide with the variation in obesity rates across the country. 
        This project investigates the possible connection of obesity rates to income and food assistance across the United States. 
        We find this topic interesting as it could uncover the reason as to why some states have higher obesity rates compared to others. 
        Additionally, our results could suggest whether food assistance addresses nutrient deficits or inadvertently contributes to the obesity rate of that specific state.

    <h1 font-size: 24px;">United States Statistics (2020-2023)</h1>

    <p id='main'>
       The following visualizations are about the statistics of obesity rate, poverty rate, and income among all states of America from the years 2020–2023.

    <h2>Tootltip Scatterplot of Yearly Statistics among States</h2>
    
    <p id='main'>
       This plot displays yearly statistics for each state from years 2020-2023 on a Obesity Rate (%) vs Average Income ($) scatterplot.
        Here, you can hover your cursor above each plotted point and get a more in-depth analysis of each state and their corresponding statistics. 
        All points are also marked with colors for the US region they reside in.

    <p id='main'>
       From this plot, we can see how generally, the higher the obesity rate of a state, the lower their average income is.

    <h2>Regional Scatterplot Visualization</h2>

    <p id='main'>
       This plot is a similar graph to the Tooltip Scatterplot but has an additional interaction where the user can highlight each region of the United States.
        From here, we are able to differentiate each region on the map by color and opacity to help the user better understand the difference between the regions.
