    <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>

    <p id='main'>
       Over the past several decades, obesity has existed as an overwhelming public health challenge in the United States, varying across states. 
        Simultaneously, economic disparities across these states have influenced these citizens' access to healthy foods, diet, and overall quality of their lifestyle. 
        For instance, metrics such as GDP per capita and state food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),  
        across states encapsulate these existing disparities and could coincide with the variation in obesity rates across the country. 
        This project investigates the possible connection of obesity rates to income and food assistance across the United States. 
        We find this topic interesting as it could uncover the reason as to why some states have higher obesity rates compared to others. 
        Additionally, our results could suggest whether food assistance addresses nutrient deficits or inadvertently contributes to the obesity rate of that specific state.

    <h1 font-size: 24px;">United States Statistics (2020-2023)</h1>

    <p id='main'>
       The following visualizations are about the statistics of obesity rate, poverty rate, and income among all states of America from the years 2020–2023.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Tootltip Scatterplot of Yearly Statistics among States</h2>
    
    <p id='main'>
       This plot displays yearly statistics for each state from years 2020-2023 on a Obesity Rate (%) vs Average Income ($) scatterplot.
        Here, you can hover your cursor above each plotted point and get a more in-depth analysis of each state and their corresponding statistics. 
        All points are also marked with colors for the US region they reside in.

    </iframe>

    <p id='main'>
       From this plot, we can see how generally, the higher the obesity rate of a state, the lower their average income is.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Regional Scatterplot Visualization</h2>

    <p id='main'>
       This plot is a similar graph to the Tooltip Scatterplot but has an additional interaction where the user can highlight each region of the United States.
        From here, we are able to differentiate each region on the map by color and opacity to help the user better understand the difference between the regions.

    <p id='main'>
       From this plot, we can see how the south generally occupy the points towards the top left of the graph, or the high obesity and low income region. 
        Additionally, the northeast region generally occupy the points towards the bottom right of the graph, or the low obesity and high income region.
        The other regions display mixed results.

    <h2>SNAP Benefits Map (June 2025)</h2>

<p id='main'>
   This interactive choropleth map of the United States visualizes SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits as of June 2025. 
    The map allows users to explore both average benefits per participating household and average benefits per participating person, 
    using data sourced from SNAP program records for each state, excluding U.S. territories. 
    Users can toggle between the two metrics using buttons located below the map, 
    while hovering over each state displays detailed information including total SNAP benefits, the number of participating households and persons, 
    and the corresponding SNAP benefits per household or per person. 
    The map uses a color gradient—blue for per participating household and green for per participating person—with darker shades representing higher benefits.

 <p id='main'>
       From this plot, we can see people from Hawaii an Alaska get the most support. This could be due to higher cost of living.

<h2>SNAP Benefits per Participating Person by State – June 2025</h2>

<p id='main'>
   This static horizontal bar chart displays the SNAP benefits per participating person for each state. 
   States are sorted from lowest to highest, with the length of each bar representing the amount of SNAP benefits per person. 
</p>

     width="1100" 
     style="display:block; margin:auto; border:1px solid #ccc;">
     
<p id='main'>
   From this chart, we can see how SNAP benefits per person vary widely across the United States. 
   Hawaii and Alaska are dramatic outliers, receiving nearly double the national average. 
    This is largely attributable to their exceptionally high costs of living—groceries in Hawaii can cost 50-90% more than the continental U.S. 
    due to shipping costs and geographic isolation. New York's high ranking likely reflects the elevated food costs in urban areas like New York City. 
    The lowest-receiving states are predominantly in the Midwest, where the cost of living—particularly food costs—tends to be lower. 
    Minnesota receives nearly $195 less per person than Hawaii, a 55% difference. 
    Interestingly, West Virginia appears here despite having high poverty rates, suggesting that SNAP calculations weight cost of living heavily over poverty levels alone.
