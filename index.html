    <h1 style="color: blue;">Mapping Obesity, Income, and Food Assistance in the U.S.</h1>

    <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>

    <p id='main'>
       Over the past several decades, obesity has existed as an overwhelming public health challenge in the United States, varying across states. 
        Simultaneously, economic disparities across these states have influenced these citizens' access to healthy foods, diet, and overall quality of their lifestyle. 
        For instance, metrics such as GDP per capita and state food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),  
        across states encapsulate these existing disparities and could coincide with the variation in obesity rates across the country. 
        This project investigates the possible connection of obesity rates to income and food assistance across the United States. 
        We find this topic interesting as it could uncover the reason as to why some states have higher obesity rates compared to others. 
        Additionally, our results could suggest whether food assistance addresses nutrient deficits or inadvertently contributes to the obesity rate of that specific state.

       From this plot, we can see how the south generally occupy the points towards the top left of the graph, or the high obesity and low income region. 
        Additionally, the northeast region generally occupy the points towards the bottom right of the graph, or the low obesity and high income region.
        The other regions display mixed results.

    <h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">SNAP Benefits Map (June 2025)</h3>

<p id='main'>
   This interactive choropleth map of the United States visualizes SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits as of June 2025. 
    The map allows users to explore both average benefits per participating household and average benefits per participating person, 
    using data sourced from SNAP program records for each state, excluding U.S. territories. 
    Users can toggle between the two metrics using buttons located below the map, 
    while hovering over each state displays detailed information including total SNAP benefits, the number of participating households and persons, 
    and the corresponding SNAP benefits per household or per person. 
    The map uses a color gradient—blue for per participating household and green for per participating person—with darker shades representing higher benefits.

<h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">SNAP Benefits per Participating Person by State – June 2025</h3>

<p id='main'>
   This static horizontal bar chart displays the SNAP benefits per participating person for each state. 
   States are sorted from lowest to highest, with the length of each bar representing the amount of SNAP benefits per person. 
</p>

     width="95%" 
     style="display:block; margin:auto; border:1px solid #ccc;">
     
<p id='main'>
   From this chart, we can see how SNAP benefits per person vary widely across the United States. 
   Hawaii and Alaska are dramatic outliers, receiving nearly double the national average. 
    This is largely attributable to their exceptionally high costs of living—groceries in Hawaii can cost 50-90% more than the continental U.S. 
    due to shipping costs and geographic isolation. New York's high ranking likely reflects the elevated food costs in urban areas like New York City. 
    The lowest-receiving states are predominantly in the Midwest, where the cost of living—particularly food costs—tends to be lower. 
    Minnesota receives nearly $195 less per person than Hawaii, a 55% difference. 
    Interestingly, West Virginia appears here despite having high poverty rates, suggesting that SNAP calculations weight cost of living heavily over poverty levels alone.

<h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">County Health Expenditures (1957-2006)</h3>

<p>
   This uses <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gov-finances/data/historical-data.html">Historical County Government finance data set</a> for the Census Bureau.
   This gives a breakdown of what a given county spent its budget on in a given year. This map specifically looks at health expenditures which includes county level health programs like
   County Health Departments, Public Health Clinics and Community health outreach.
</p>
<p>
   SNAP is a federally funded program however there are many health initiatives to be started at a local level. This map shows the county health expenditures per capita in the USA from 1957 to 2006.
   The coloring is relative to the entire dataset. This map shows us that not only have expenditures at a county level increased greatly in the past 50 years but also 
   reporting of heath expenditures has increased.

<h3 style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">State Expenditures and Obesity Rates (2021-2023)</h3>

<p>
This graph uses the ASFIN dataset from 2021-2023. 
The top graph uses the average obestiy rate at a state level from 2021 to 2023. 
The bottom graph overlays each states expenditures in Health, Public Welfare and Education as a percentage of the total of those three categories.
They share an x axis which is sorted by average obesity rate of the 3 years for that given state.
</p>

<p>
This graph reveals that overall investments in health intialtives and general public wellbeing improve obesity rates at a state level. However there is no clear category which is most effective 
from the data presented.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p id='main'>
        This project examined the complex relationships between obesity rates, income levels, and food assistance programs across the United States. 
        Our analysis revealed several key findings that illuminate the multifaceted nature of this public health challenge.
    </p>

    <p id='main'>
        First, we observed clear regional patterns in the relationship between obesity and income. The Southern states consistently occupy the high obesity, low income quadrant of our visualizations, 
        while Northeastern states tend toward lower obesity rates and higher incomes. This geographic divide suggests that economic factors play a significant role in obesity prevalence, 
        though the relationship is not uniformly consistent across all regions.
    </p>

    <p id='main'>
        Second, our examination of SNAP benefits revealed substantial variation across states, with Hawaii and Alaska receiving dramatically higher per-person benefits—nearly double the national average. 
        This variation appears to be primarily driven by cost of living differences rather than poverty rates alone, as evidenced by states like West Virginia having high poverty yet lower SNAP benefits per person. 
        This finding suggests that food assistance programs do account for geographic economic disparities, though the effectiveness of these adjustments in addressing nutritional needs remains an open question.
    </p>

    <p id='main'>
        Third, the historical analysis of county health expenditures from 1957 to 2006 demonstrates a significant increase in both spending and reporting on public health initiatives at the local level. 
        When combined with our state-level expenditure analysis, the data indicates that investments in health, public welfare, and education are associated with improved obesity outcomes. 
        However, no single category of spending emerges as definitively most effective, suggesting that comprehensive approaches addressing multiple factors may be necessary.
    </p>

    <p id='main'>
        Ultimately, this research demonstrates that obesity rates cannot be attributed to a single factor. Instead, they result from the interplay of economic conditions, regional characteristics, 
        food assistance accessibility, and public health investments. While SNAP and other assistance programs help address food insecurity, particularly in high-cost-of-living areas, 
        the persistent high obesity rates in low-income regions indicate that access to affordable food alone may not be sufficient. Future interventions may need to address not just food availability 
        but also food quality, nutritional education, healthcare access, and broader economic opportunities to meaningfully reduce obesity disparities across American states.
